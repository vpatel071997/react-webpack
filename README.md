# React boilerplate using webpack
`create-react-app` is quiet bloated and takes unreasonable amount of time to build and start. For the beginners it is recommended to use boilerplate usign wbepack to create react apps. I have created this boilerplate project, using you can create react application using webpack. Another feature is this application allows you to access node modules within react components.

* Open terminal, Clone this project
* Go to root directory of the project
* run `npm i && npm run serve`
* Click on `http://localhost:3030` in your terminal to run the app in your web browser
